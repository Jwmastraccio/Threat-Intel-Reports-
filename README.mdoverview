# Threat-Intel-Reports-
This repository contains a portfolio of **threat intelligence reports created as part of my cybersecurity work and study. Each report is structured like a professional intelligence product, including:
**Executive summary**
**threat Actor Background**
**Campaign Analysis**
**MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**
**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**
**Defensive Recommendations**

The reports demonstrate my ability to:
-Analyze cyber threat campaigns using open-source intelligence (OSINT)
-Map attackers TTPs to MITRE ATT&CK
-Document and organizeIOCs in a format suitable for SIEM/EDR ingestion
-Communicate findings in both technical and non-technical language
